# Project Proposal 

## Emily DiPressi and Tiffany Feng 

## Research Question

In todayâ€™s political climate, the effects of government policies are more important than ever. In our analysis, we hope to shed light on possible changes to implement in order to promote public good. **Does inefficient government spending on children lead to higher rates of hate crimes and/or gun violence for US states?**


## Importance

If we are able to find a correlation between government spending on children and violence in the nation, we can use this research to better inform government spending and to advocate for changes.

## Spatial Scope

The spatial scope of our project is the United States (broken down by state). We decided on this spatial scope due to the geo data available to us in our datasets. Spatial scope matters in our project because government spending in the US is often depicted by state.

## Data Sources

Our first dataset is on hate crimes. This dataset has information on [hate crimes](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes) per 100,000, ranging from 2009-2016. Also included is information on the population: unemployment, citizenship, poverty levels, all broken down by state in the U.S. The second dataset we have is on [gun violence](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data) from January 2013-March 2018. This dataset is inspired by the Parkland school shooting tragedy. In an effort to bring more gun violence data to the foreground, this is a record of over 200,000 gun violence cases that includes the date, location, victim info, and urls that speak on each incident. Finally, our last dataset focuses on [government spending in the U.S. on kids](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-09-15). The data was collected from 1997-2016. It is a state by state breakdown of spending on education, income security, and health on children. The data, specifically, is broken down by state, year, and dollar amount spent. 

## Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations

Our project will be analyzing data at the state level in the United States. We plan to create choropleth maps of the US states based on our data on government spending on kids, hate crimes, and gun violence to see if there is any relationship between the three. In addition to disaggregating our data by state, we plan to also visualize our data by creating line graphs and bar charts to find trends among our data over time or regions that we can investigate further.

## Expectations for Research Insights

Through our research, we hope to see if there is a relationship between US state-by-state government spending on youth and violence/intolerance in the country.
