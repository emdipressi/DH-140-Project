# Week 4 Status Update 

## Emily DiPressi and Tiffany Feng 

## Project Title:
Inefficient Government Spending on Children and Crime

## Roles

* Emily: Hate Crime Data
* Tiffany: Government Spending Data

## Status Update:

* Started off feeling relatively good. Confident in our subject. 
* As the midterm due date approaches, we are a little nervous about the project.
* Struggling with the technical side of the project.

## Data Update:

* We have decided that maybe our scope was too broad, we were trying to include too many datasets and subjects into one project, and this made it difficult to get started on the project. Moving forward we will narrow down our datasets. 
* We should include census data to have a more concrete location for our maps. 
* Hate crimes data has an educational level, census data also has that 

## Concerns:

* Minor: Data has location but no lat/long values or geometry value. How to incorporate location into data?
* Major: Timing of the project
